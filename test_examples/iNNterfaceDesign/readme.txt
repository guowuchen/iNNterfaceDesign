1. Example of test run for design of most probable (top) 6-residue motifs for a few anchor residues

pdb: 3ztj_ABCDEF.pdb
input file: input_top
output: "3ztj_top" folder
designed amino acid sequences in 3ztj_top/3ztj_top_aas.json file
deisgned backbones in 3ztj_top/binders_id folder

2. Example of test run for design of all 6-residue motifs with probability of position higher than 2% according to PepBB for a few anchor residues

pdb: 3ztj_ABCDEF.pdb
input file: input_all
output: "3ztj_all" folder
designed amino acid sequences in 3ztj_all/3ztj_all_aas.json file
deisgned backbones in 3ztj_all/binders_id folder
